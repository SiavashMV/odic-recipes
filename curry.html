        Ingredients:
    </h2>
    <p>This recipe is pretty simple and does not need a lot of different ingredients. You can buy everything in a single trip to the supermarket, and of course, you can substitute a lot of the ingredients as you see fit!.</p>
    <p>Here are all the things you need:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>200gr of green peas</li>
        <li>1 can of coconut milk</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>Chilli powder</li>
                <li>Tumeric</li>
            </ul>
        <li>500gr white rice</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>First, cut your chicken in smaller pieces. Aim for small unifrom cubes. This will add a lot of visual pleasentness 
        to your food. Chop your onions and put them on low heat and stir them until they are golden brown.
    </p>
    <p>When the onions are ready, add your chicken. Stir them together until your chicken is not pink on the outside. Now, add your spices and
        let them "bloom" for a while. This is an importnat step, as blooming your spices adds a lot of taste to your dish.
    </p>
    <p>Now you can add your green peas and the coconut milk to the mix. You can now put the lid on and let your curry cook on low hit for a while.
        <strong>Remember:</strong><em>The curry has to come to boil first, then you can turn the heat low and let it simmer.</em>
    </p>
    <p>As you are waiting for your curry to finish cooking, you should start cooking your rice in a small pot. This should take somewhere around 15 minutes.
        As always, <strong>make sure your are adding just the right amount of water to your rice</strong> - not too much, not too little!
    </p>
    <p>That's it! Enjoy your curry.</p>
