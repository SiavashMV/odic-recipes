        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Well this is actually not a family recipe. I'm just going to steal the text from a recipe website (if you are curious, <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/20568/lasagne-verdi-al-forno/">this one.</a>
        So the description is as follows:</p>
        <p>A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy; this lasagna made with spinach pasta cannot be beat.
             It's excellent if you want to impress some guests, or even yourself. It may be a bit time consuming, but it's well worth the TLC you put into it.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1</li>
                    <p>For the pasta dough: Steam the spinach in a steamer or over boiling water until bright green, 2 minutes. Squeeze to remove excess moisture and process in a food processor to make a paste. Combine spinach with eggs, semolina, and salt and process until smooth. 
                    Stir in enough of the flour to make a smooth dough. Knead briefly, cover and set aside.</p>
                <li>Step 2</li>
                    <p>For the ragu: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Saute bacon, carrot, celery and onion until onion is translucent. Stir in ground pork, ground beef and minced ham, and cook until browned. 
                    Stir in tomato paste, oregano and beef stock. (Reserve the chicken livers for later.) Season with salt and pepper, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 20 minutes.</p>
                <li>Step 3</li>
                    <p>For the bechamel: While the ragu is simmering, combine 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons flour in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk to make a roux. Remove from heat, let rest one minute, then whisk in warm milk. 
                        Return to heat, simmer 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat.</p>
            </ol>
